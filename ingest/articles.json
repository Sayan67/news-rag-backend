        "text": "Editor\u2019s Note: This story is part of \u2018Systems Error\u2019, a series by CNN As Equals, investigating how your gender shapes your life online. For information about how CNN As Equals is funded and more, check out our FAQs.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nCatfishing is when a person uses false information and images to create a fake identity online with the intention to trick, harass, or scam another person. It is often on social media or dating apps and websites as a common tactic used to form online relationships under false pretenses, sometimes to lure people into financial scams.\n\nThe person doing the pretending, or the \u201ccatfish\u201d may also obtain intimate images from a victim and use them to extort or blackmail the person. This is known as sextortion, or they may use other personal information shared with them to commit identity theft.\n\nThe term is believed to originate from the 2010 documentary \u201cCatfish,\u201d in which a young Nev Schulman starts an online relationship with teenager \u201cMegan\u201d, who turns out to be an older woman.\n\nIn the final scene of the documentary, the woman\u2019s husband shares an anecdote about how live cod used to be exported from Alaska alongside catfish, which kept the cod active and alert. He likened this to people in real life who keep others on their toes, like his wife. Schulman went on to produce the docuseries Catfish\n\nWhy do people catfish?\n\nThere are many reasons people resort to catfishing, but the most common reason is a lack of confidence, according to the Cybersmile Foundation, a nonprofit focused on digital well-being. The foundation states that if someone is not happy with themselves, they may feel happier when pretending to be someone more attractive to others.\n\nThey may also hide their identity to troll someone; to engage in a relationship other than their existing one; or to extort or harass people. Some people may catfish to explore sexual preferences.\n\nStudies have shown that catfish are more likely to be educated men, with one 2022 study finding perpetrators are more likely to come from religious backgrounds, possibly providing a way to form relationships without the constraints they face in real life, the authors write.\n\nIn another study published last year, Evita March, senior lecturer in psychology at Federation University in Australia, found that people with the strong personality traits of sadism, psychopathy, and narcissism were more likely to catfish.\n\nMarch told CNN the findings are preliminary and that her team would like to further investigate if certain personality traits lead to specific kinds of catfishing behavior.\n\nIn the US, romance scams resulting from catfishing have among the highest reported financial losses of internet crimes as a whole. A total of 19,050 Americans reported losing almost $740 million to romance scammers in 2022.\n\nIn the UK, the country\u2019s National Fraud Intelligence Bureau received more than 8,000 reports of romance fraud in the 2022 financial year, totaling more than \u00a392 million (US $116.6 million) lost, with an average loss of \u00a311,500 (US $14,574) per victim.\n\nIn Singapore, romance scams are among the top 10 reported scams. The reported amount of money catfish may get from their victims increased by more than 30% from SGD$33.1 million (US $24 million) in 2020 to $46.6 million (US $34 million) the following year.\n\nCatfishing is also increasingly happening on an industrial scale with the rise of \u201ccyber scam centers\u201d that have links to human trafficking in Southeast Asia, according to INTERPOL.\n\nVictims of trafficking are forced to become fraudsters by creating fake social media accounts and dating profiles to scam and extort millions of dollars from people around the world using different schemes such as fake crypto investment sites.\n\nWho are the most common victims of catfishing?\n\nCatfishing used to occur more among adults through online dating sites, but has now become equally common among teenagers, according to the Cybersmile Foundation.\n\nResearch by Snapchat last year with more than 6,000 Gen Z teenagers and young people in Australia, France, Germany, India, the UK and the US found that almost two-thirds of them or their friends had been targeted by catfish or hackers to obtain private images that were later used to extort them.\n\nOlder people are also likely to lose more money to catfishing. In 2021, Americans lost half a billion dollars through romance scams perpetrated by people using fake personas or impersonating others, with the largest losses paid in cryptocurrency, according to the US Federal Trade Commission. The number of reports rose tenfold among young people (18-29) but older people (over 70s) generally reported losing more money.\n\nIn Australia, a third of dating and romance scams result in financial losses, with women having lost more than double the total amount lost by men, and older people again losing more money than those under 45, according to data from the country\u2019s National Anti-Scam Centre.\n\n\u201dRomance scams are one of the hardest things to avoid. It\u2019s emotional manipulation,\u201d said Ngo Minh Hieu, a Vietnamese former hacker and founder of Chong Lua Dao (scam fighters), a cybersecurity non-profit.\n\nSince 2020, Hieu has been monitoring trends to help scam victims, he says, and explains that in his experience, a catfish would usually approach a victim with premediated intention to scam them.\n\nThey were likely to be using personal information that they mine from the victim\u2019s social media accounts, or may have bought that data from users in private chat groups simply by providing a phone number of a potential victim.\n\nThe signs you\u2019re being catfished\n\nThere are many signs you can look for to help spot a catfish, experts say.\n\nFirstly, a catfish might contact you out of nowhere, start regular conversations with you and shower you with compliments to quickly build up trust and rapport. They may state desirable qualities in their opening conversations, including wealth or attractiveness, but then rarely or never call you, either over the phone or on a video call.\n\nThey often do not have many friends on social media and their posts are usually scarce. Search results using their name may not yield many results and their stories are usually inconsistent. For example, personal details like where they live or go to school might change when discussed again.\n\nAnother classic sign is if the feelings they declare for you escalate quickly and after a short period of time. A catfish may ask you for sensitive images and money.\n\nMany scammers use already available photos of other people in their fake personas, which may be possible to spot using a reverse image search.\n\nWith the explosion of AI technology, scammers may now generate unique and realistic images for use as profile pictures. But Hieu explains that thanks to their built-in patterns by design, AI-generated images can be detected, using tools such as AI-Generated Image Detector.\n\nWhat to do if you have been catfished\n\nIf you believe you are being catfished, there are steps you can take to protect yourself and help end the targeting.\n\nExperts advise that you should not be afraid to ask direct questions or challenge the person you believe may be catfishing you. You can do this by asking them why they are not willing to call you or meet face to face, or questioning how they can declare their love for you so quickly.\n\nFangzhou Wang, a cybercrime professor at the University of Texas at Arlington, and her colleagues sent nearly 200 deterrent messages to active scammers in a 2020 study and concluded that this could make fraudsters respond less or in some cases, admit to wrongdoing.\n\nAn example of one of the messages was: \u201cI know you are scamming innocent people. My friend was recently arrested for the same offense and is facing five years in prison. You should stop before you face the same fate.\u201d\n\nYou should think about stopping all communications with the catfish, and refrain from sending money to them at the risk of further financial demands. Experts say catfish continue to target those who engage with them more.\n\nIt\u2019s also useful to secure your online accounts and ensure your personal information is kept private online.\n\nCybersecurity expert Hieu explained that you can do this by putting personal information such as your phone number, email addresses and date of birth in private mode on social media. You can also check if your email has been compromised in a data breach by using tools such as the Have I Been Pwned website.\n\nInstalling two-factor authentication on your accounts can also help protect against unauthorized access. That requires you to take a second step to verify your identity when logging in to a service, for example by SMS or a physical device, such as a key fob.\n\nBeing subjected to catfishing can also have a significant impact on your mental health, with many victims left unable to trust others and some left feeling embarrassed about falling for the scam. A 2019 study found that young LGBTQ+ men in rural America experiencing catfishing on dating apps felt angry and fearful.\n\nIf someone was \u201csextorted,\u201d they may continue to fear their images resurfacing online in the future.\n\nMarch from Federation University in Australia recommended improving digital literacy and staying aware of the potential red flags. She also emphasized the need to recognize today\u2019s loneliness epidemic, which \u201cleads people to perhaps be more susceptible to catfishing scams,\u201d she said.\n\nSeeking professional support from a counselor or talking to supportive friends and family is one way to address loneliness, March added.\n\nIs catfishing a crime?\n\nCatfishing is not explicitly a crime, but the actions that often accompany catfishing, such as extortion for money, gifts or sexual images are crimes in many places.\n\nThe main challenge in tackling online fraud is the issue of jurisdiction, according to a 2020 paper about police handling of online fraud victims in Australia. Traditional policing operates within specific territories, but the internet has blurred these boundaries, the author writes.\n\nCybercriminals from one country can also target victims in other countries, complicating law enforcement efforts, and victims often face difficulty and frustration when trying to report cybercrimes, which can further traumatize them.\n\nWang told CNN that virtual private networks (VPNs), forged credentials, and anonymous communication methods make it extremely difficult to determine identities or locations.\n\nScammers have also capitalized on the proliferation of AI, such as AI-generated personas, which complicates the ability of law enforcement authorities to gather evidence and build cases against a catfish.\n\n\u201dLaw enforcement agencies, often constrained by limited resources and prioritizing cases based on severity and direct impact, might not readily prioritize catfishing cases without substantial financial losses or physical harm,\u201d Wang told CNN.\n\nIn the US, there are some legal precedents. In 2022, a woman who had created multiple fake profiles to target wealthy men was charged with extortion, cyberstalking, and interstate threats and was sentenced in a plea deal last year.\n\nIn the UK, while catfishing itself is not classified as a criminal offense, if the person using a fake profile engages in illegal activities, like financial gain or harassment, they can be punished by law.\n\nChina has a law that implicates people who allow their websites or communications platforms to be used for frauds and other illegal activities under Article 46 in the Cybersecurity Law.\n\nIn the US, romance scams resulting from catfishing have among the highest reported financial losses of internet crimes as a whole. Maryna Terletska/Moment RF/Getty Images\n\nHow to report a catfish\n\nIf a catfish has tricked you into sending them money, you can go to the authorities and your bank immediately, depending on where you are.\n\nIf activities that are crimes in your country have taken place because of being catfished, such as extortion, identify theft or harassment, the police or other authorities, such as specific commissions targeting online crime, may be your first port of call.\n\nThe Australian government\u2019s agency responsible for online safety, the e-safety commissioner, advises that people gather all the evidence they can, including screenshots of the scammer and chats with them to keep as evidence.\n\nDepending on the case, you can also submit an abuse or impersonation report against the catfish directly to the platform on which you are communicating with them.\n\nIf you believe the person you are talking to is not who they say they are, most of the larger social media platforms give you the option report them for impersonation or other forms of abuse, including Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, X, Telegram, Tinder and WhatsApp. WeChat also offers a channel to report another user for harassment, fraud, or illegal activity, while Telegram creates an anti-scam thread for users to report on fraudsters.\n\nHow you can protect yourself against catfishing?\n\nYou are not responsible for the catfish behaviors of others, but staying vigilant and alert online goes a long way.\n\nMake sure your online accounts are secured and use two-factor authentication. When browsing the internet, you may want to use a virtual private network (VPN) which makes your internet activity harder to track.\n\nIn many countries such as the US, the UK and Australia, victims have reported being preyed on by catfish who tricked them to put money in bogus cryptocurrency investment sites.\n\nIf someone you have been talking to asks you to put money into an investment site, think twice. The Global Anti-Scam Organization has a database of fraudulent websites generated by their own investigations and the public\u2019s tip offs to help inform you if you\u2019re being scammed.\n\nIf you are a parent, this guide provided by the UK-based National College platform suggests communicating effectively and sensitively with your children about the risks. You may also help them report and block the catfish accounts and report to police if they have been subjected to anything illegal or inappropriate.\n\nBecause catfish get close to a target often by relying on personal information posted on social media, UNICEF asks children to consider their rights when it comes to parents sharing their pictures and other content online, especially when they are underage.",

        "text": "Qatar's human rights record is under scrutiny as the World Cup takes place in Doha. A lot has been written about the treatment of migrant workers who built the stadiums and hotels, but much less about the foreign maids who work for Qatar's ruling classes. On paper their rights have been strengthened in recent years - but the new rules aren't always followed.\n\nI make contact with Gladys (not her real name) late at night, after her employers from the Qatari elite have gone to bed.\n\nIn a brief online conversation she tells me she works from 8am to 11pm every day. She cleans, helps prepare food and looks after the children.\n\nShe eats what's left from the family's meals, and says she hasn't had a day off since she started 18 months ago.\n\n\"Madam is crazy,\" Gladys, a Filipina woman in her 40s, says about her employer. \"She shouts at me every day.\"\n\nBefore Qatar won the competition to host the 2022 World Cup, foreign workers were unable to change jobs or leave the country without their employer's permission. It's still like this in most Gulf states.\n\nUnder scrutiny, Qatar began to introduce reforms, but Amnesty International says these have failed to end a pattern of abuses faced by domestic workers.\n\nFor example, Gladys's employer has held on to her passport, preventing her from leaving without his consent.\n\nBut Gladys still feels lucky. At least she has been allowed to keep her phone, she says, unlike some other foreign maids. Also, she is not physically abused. In Qatar, this happens all too often, she says.\n\nThere is another reason she wants to stay in her current job - she thinks it's unlikely at her age that she will get a better one. She earns 1,500 rials a month (just under \u00a3350) and is able to send it all home to support her family.",

        "text": "Digital travel scams are a growing \"systemic and global\" problem, according to the World Tourism Organization, a branch of the UN. Dozens of Brazilian women have been finding this out the hard way, after paying for luxury holidays from a man whose Instagram account sparkles with opulent hotels and exotic locations.\n\nLast December Maria (not her real name) decided to have a break from the heat of the Australian summer, and to take her family on a skiing holiday to Europe.\n\nIt was her first trip since the pandemic and she wanted it to be special. So she paid $20,000 to a travel agent, Rafael Bessa, a fellow Brazilian who had been recommended by a friend, and made the long flight north.\n\nTo begin with, everything was perfect, but as Maria checked out of the third hotel the manager told her the room had not been paid for.\n\nTwo further shocks came in quick succession. When Maria contacted Rafael Bessa to ask for help, she noticed he was unable to talk to the hotel manager in French, despite his claim to have attended an exclusive boarding school in the Alps. Then, when the family boarded a train to their next destination, there was a problem with the tickets: he had provided two tickets with the same purchase number, meaning that only one was valid.\n\nAt the next hotel it was a similar story: Maria had to settle the bill, even though she had paid in full already.\n\nInitially she had assumed Rafael Bessa was simply incompetent. \"Then I said, 'No, this is not a mistake, this is on purpose. This is in bad faith.'\"",

        "title": "Deepfaked: \u2018They put my face on a porn video\u2019",
        "text": "In the past, high-profile celebrities and politicians were the most common targets of deepfakes - the videos weren't always porn, some were made for comedic value. But over the years that's changed - according to cybersecurity company Deeptrace, 96% of all deepfakes are non-consensual porn.\n\nLike revenge porn, deepfake pornography is what's known as image-based sexual abuse - an umbrella term which encompasses the taking, making and/or sharing of intimate images without consent.\n\nIt is already an offence in Scotland to share images or videos that show another person in an intimate situation without their consent. But in other parts of the UK, it's only an offence if it can be proved that such actions were intended to cause the victim distress - a loophole which means video creators often don't face legal consequences.\n\nGovernment plans for a long-awaited UK-wide Online Safety Bill have been under endless revision and repeatedly shelved. The new laws would give the regulator, Ofcom, the power to take action against any website deemed to be enabling harm to UK users, no matter where they are based in the world. Earlier this month, however, Culture Secretary Michelle Donelan said, external she and her team were now \"working flat out\" to ensure the bill was delivered.\n\nKate, 30, founded the #NotYourPorn campaign in 2019. A year later, her activism contributed to the adult entertainment website, Pornhub, having to take down all videos uploaded to the site by unverified users - the majority of its content.\n\nKate therefore assumed that whoever was behind the deepfake of her had been annoyed by her campaigning. She had \"taken away their porn\".\n\nBut she had no idea who that person was, or who might have seen the video. And while she could see that her face had been overlaid onto footage of a porn actor, the video was convincing enough that she worried others might not spot the deception.\n\n\"It was a violation - my identity was used in a way I didn't consent to.\"\n\nUnderneath the video, people began leaving streams of abusive comments, saying they were going to follow Kate home, rape her, film the attack, and publish the footage on the internet.\n\n\"You start thinking about your family,\" she says, holding back tears. \"How would they feel if they saw this content?\"\n\nThe threat intensified when both Kate's home and work addresses were published below the video - a practice known as doxing.\n\n\"I became completely paranoid - 'Who knows my address? Is it someone I know that's done this?'\n\n\"I was thinking, 'I'm really in trouble here, this isn't just some people on the internet mouthing off, there's actually a real danger.'\"\n\nFrom her experience supporting others in similar situations, Kate knew exactly what to do if someone becomes a victim - but in that moment she froze.\n\n\"I didn't follow any of my own advice,\" she says. \"Kate the campaigner was very strong and didn't show any vulnerability - and then there was me, Kate, who was really scared.\"\n\nA colleague reported the video, vicious comments and doxing to Twitter, and they were all taken down from the platform. But once any deepfake has been published and shared online it's difficult to remove it from circulation entirely.\n\n\"I just wanted that video off the internet,\" Kate says, \"but there was nothing I could do about it.\"\n\nThere's a marketplace for deepfakes in online forums. People post requests for videos to be made of their wives, neighbours and co-workers and - unfathomable as it might seem - even their mothers, daughters and cousins.\n\nContent creators respond with step-by-step instructions - what source material they'll need, advice on which filming angles work best, and price tags for the work.\n\nA deepfake content creator based in south-east England, Gorkem, spoke to the BBC anonymously. He began creating celebrity deepfakes for his own gratification - he says they allow people to \"realise their fantasies in ways that really wasn't [sic] possible before\".\n\nLater, Gorkem moved on to deepfaking women he was attracted to, including colleagues at his day job who he barely knew.",

They say people from the UK are the most generous gifters.\n\nMona Ali Al-Karim and her six daughters are among the families who go live on TikTok every day, sitting on the floor of their tent for hours, repeating the few English phrases they know: \"Please like, please share, please gift.\"\n\nMona's husband was killed in an airstrike and she is using the livestreams to raise money for an operation for her daughter Sharifa, who is blind.\n\nThe gifts they're asking for are virtual, but they cost the viewers real money and can be withdrawn from the app as cash. Livestream viewers send the gifts - ranging from digital roses, costing a few cents, to virtual lions costing around $500 - to reward or tip creators for content.\n\nFor five months, the BBC followed 30 TikTok accounts broadcasting live from Syrian camps for displaced people and built a computer program to scrape information from them, showing that viewers were often donating digital gifts worth up to $1,000 an hour to each account.\n\nFamilies in the camps said they were receiving only a tiny fraction of these sums, however.\n\nWith TikTok declining to say how much it takes from gifts, the BBC ran an experiment to track where the money goes.\n\nA reporter in Syria contacted one of the TikTok-affiliated agencies saying he was living in the camps. He obtained an account and went live, while BBC staff in London sent TikTok gifts worth $106 from another account.\n\nAt the end of the livestream, the balance of the Syrian test account was $33.

Yes, I do. But I generally come back to the point that I would rather that be the case, than we're convicting people of serious offences that are genuinely not guilty,\" she said.\n\n\"The only thing I can say is that you hope the criminal trial process will enable those genuine cases to be pulled out from those less genuine.\"\n\nSexsomnia and other sleepwalking defences should always be robustly challenged in court, according to the CPS guidelines.\n\nBut Jade's case never made it to court. Armed with her research, she submitted her appeal, known as a victim's right to review.\n\nA chief crown prosecutor, independent of the CPS department which made the original decision to close the case, reviewed all the evidence again.\n\nHe concluded the case should have gone to trial - and that the sleep experts' opinions, and the defendant's account, should have been challenged in court.\n\nA jury would have been \"more likely than not\" to convict the defendant, he said - one of the tests a case must meet for the CPS to take it to trial.\n\n\"I cannot begin to imagine what you have been through and how you feel. I noted during my review the devastating effect of this case on you,\" he wrote to Jade.\n\n\"I apologise unreservedly for this on behalf of the Crown Prosecution Service although I appreciate that is likely to be of little consolation to you.\"",

Launching the remaining lifeboats on the port side safely was near impossible.\n\nInstead of being lowered down to the water once loaded up with people, the lifeboats would cling to the side of the ship until the next big wave rolled in, tipping the ship enough to let them dangle freely.\n\n\"And then gravity would suddenly drop the lifeboat three or four metres (13 ft) in one go, almost tipping people out into the open water, it was horrific,\" Moss says.\n\nEventually, he realised it was too dangerous to continue.\n\n\"In the effort to try and rescue people we were possibly going to kill them,\" Moss says.\n\nAnd time was running out.\n\nUnable to launch any more lifeboats, but with hundreds of people still in need of rescue, Moss and others made their way up to the ship's bridge - where they assumed they would find the captain and the remaining senior officers - to ask what to do next.\n\n\"We looked inside, but there was no one there,\" Moss says. \"That's when we realised - it's just us.\"\n\nOrangey-red lights blinked in the darkness, but Moss had no idea what most of the equipment was for, never mind how it worked. They took turns trying to use the radio to send an SOS.\n\n\"I was calling, 'Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!' and just waiting for somebody to answer,\" Moss says.\n\nA big, deep, rich voice eventually replied. \"Yes, what is your Mayday?\"\n\nRelieved, Moss explained that he was on the cruise ship Oceanos and that it was sinking.\n\n\"OK. How long have you got left to float?\"\n\n\"I don't know - we've got the starboard railings in the water, we're rolling around, we've taken on a huge amount of water,\" Moss said. \"We still have at least 200 people on board.\"\n\n\"OK. What is your position?\"\n\n\"We're probably about halfway between the port of East London and Durban.\"\n\n\"No, no, no, what are your coordinates?\"\n\nMoss had no idea what their coordinates were.\n\n\"What rank are you?\"\n\n\"Well, I'm not a rank - I'm a guitarist.\"\n\nA moment's silence.\n\n\"What are you doing on the bridge?\"\n\n\"Well, there's nobody else here.\"\n\n\"Who's on the bridge with you?\"\n\n\"So I said, 'It's me, my wife - the bass player, we've got a magician here\u2026'\"\n\nMoss was put in contact with two small ships that were close to the Oceanos. They told Moss to find the captain and get him onto the bridge. But Moss had no idea where he was.\n\n\"I knew he wouldn't be down below because we were sinking,\" he says. \"I was making regular checks to see where the water level was, and one deck below us was flooded.\"\n\nEventually, Moss found the captain, right at the back of the ship, smoking in the darkness. Moss explained that they needed his help - urgently.\n\n\"He was just looking at me, wide-eyed and vacant, saying, 'It's not necessary, it's not necessary,'\" Moss says.\n\n\"I think he was in deep, deep shock.\"\n\nThe two ships close to the Oceanos had only one lifeboat each, so there was little they could do to help. They shared the sinking vessel's coordinates with the South African authorities who began to organise an air rescue mission.",

        "text": "Ken now visits Julie's farm. He has a twinkle in his eye, but his clarity of speech has gone. \"It's a horrible disease,\" says his wife Sue. \"It's taken his life away.\"\n\nShe says its manufacture in the UK and export should be stopped. \"I wouldn't want my son, who's got farming qualifications, ending up like his father.\"\n\nParaquat has not been authorised for use in the EU since a court ruling in 2007. That is still the case in the UK after Brexit but it is still made - under the brand name Gramoxone - at Syngenta's plant in Huddersfield. It is exported to countries such as the US, Japan and Australia, with a fifth of exports going to the developing world.\n\nIn the US, nearly 900 farmers and field workers have joined forces to sue the manufacturer, claiming not only is there a link between Paraquat and Parkinson's, but that Syngenta has deliberately hidden the health risks from the authorities.\n\nSyngenta rejects the claims made in the remaining multidistrict litigation case, which is due to come to court later this year.\n\nThe company's most recent financial statement shows that the company has already paid $187.5m into a settlement fund. But it said the company believes that all of these claims are without merit and the payment is simply to keep the claims from going any further.\n\nToxicologist Prof Jon Heylings worked for Syngenta and its predecessor companies for more than 20 years. After retiring, he turned whistleblower, and has given evidence as an expert witness in the US legal action.\n\nHe said farmers who used it without protective equipment, damaging their skin, should be worried. \"If they went out the next day and actually used it again, and the next day, you could absorb more Paraquat through the skin, into the blood and then into the brain,\" he says.\n\n\"The issue is really does it actually cause Parkinson's when it gets into the brain? That's one of the key issues around the whole exposure. And if this chemical does cause Parkinson's, who is responsible?\"\n\nThere is no scientific consensus and many conflicting studies on any possible association between Paraquat and Parkinson's.\n\nIn the UK, research charity Cure Parkinson's said exposure was \"a well-recognised environmental risk factor\" but Parkinson's UK said studies show \"a small increased risk\" at most.\n\nIn the US, a 17-year-long study found Paraquat contributed to Parkinson's onset and progression. And research by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences - part of the US Department of Health - found people who used Paraquat developed Parkinson's two-and-a-half times more often than non-users.\n\nBut the US regulator, the Environmental Protection Agency, says an updated study couldn't replicate those results and no clear link was found.",

        "text": "Wildlife Photographer of the Year 2025 \u2013 the best pictures so far\n\n26 August 2025 Share Save Maddie Molloy BBC Climate & Science Share Save\n\nBidyut Kalita This image titled \"Special Delivery\" was highly commended in the Behaviour: Invertebrates category.\n\nAt first glance, the potter wasp appears to be riding a broomstick. But this industrious insect isn't flying back to stir its witch's cauldron, or playing Quidditch. It's carrying a caterpillar \u2013 prey to feed its young. It was captured by macro wildlife photographer Bidyut Kalita and was among the runner-up or 'highly commended' entries in this year's Wildlife Photographer of the Year competition. The winning images will be announced on 14 October, followed by an exhibition at the Natural History Museum, showcasing 100 standout photographs from around the world. Scroll down to explore other highly commended works from the competition.\n\nEmmanuel Tardy\n\nTitle: No Place Like Home Photographer: Emmanuel Tardy (France) Location: El Tanque, San Carlos, Alajuela, Costa Rica Mr Tardy captured a brown\u2011throated three\u2011toed sloth clinging to a barbed wire post after crossing a road. As their habitats become fragmented due to tree loss, sloths are forced to make more ground crossings to reach the next tree, leaving them vulnerable.\n\nBertie Gregory\n\nTitle: Ice Edge Journey Photographer: Bertie Gregory (UK) Location: Ekstr\u00f6m Ice Shelf, Atka Bay, Antarctica Mr Gregory captured a group of fledgling emperor penguin chicks teetering on the edge of an ice shelf. After spending two months observing the colony, he saw most chicks using natural ice ramps to descend safely to the sea \u2013 but this group had missed the easier route down. Left to fend for themselves, emperor penguin chicks must eventually take a leap into the icy ocean for their first attempt at feeding. Scientists believe that the decline in sea ice may force penguins to breed on ice shelves, making leaps like this a more common thing.\n\nKutub Uddin\n\nTitle: Slime Family Portrait Photographer: Kutub Uddin (Bangladesh/UK) Location: Slindon Wood, West Sussex, England, UK Mr Uddin discovered a grouping of slime moulds arranged on a fallen log in a forest. He described the scene as a \"bizarre family portrait,\" complete with a tiny yellow insect egg. A slime mould consists of mobile, single-celled, amoeba-like organisms that live independently but can come together to function as a single entity in order to find food and reproduce.\n\nJamie Smart\n\nTitle: Rutting Call Photographer: Jamie Smart (UK) Location: Bradgate Park, Leicestershire, UK A red deer stag bellows during the autumn rut at Bradgate Park, as captured by Miss Smart from a safe distance. She avoided long grass by stretching upwards to keep the view clear. The stag's antlers, now fully hardened and velvet\u2011free, regrow each spring, becoming more impressive with each year as new points called tines develop.\n\nAmit Eshel\n\nTitle: Inside the Pack Photographer: Amit Eshel (Israel) Location: Ellesmere Island, Nunavut, Canada Eye\u2011level with an inquisitive Arctic wolf pack in \u221235 C, Mr Eshel fulfilled his dream to photograph these elusive creatures. The wolves came so close he could smell their breath. Arctic wolves, found only in Canada's north and northern Greenland, are curious of humans due to minimal exposure.\n\nKesshav Vikram\n\nTitle: Essence of Kamchatka Photographer: Kesshav Vikram (India) Location: Kurile Lake, Kamchatka Krai, Russia After days of patience, Mr Vikram captured a brown bear walking along the shores of Kurile Lake, with Iliinsky volcano looming through cloud. Whilst bears are generally solitary, this one was heading to feast with others on the glut of sockeye salmon migrating upriver from the Pacific to their origin lake to spawn.\n\nParham Pourahmad\n\nTitle: A Tale of Two Coyotes Photographer: Parham Pourahmad (USA) Location: Bernal Heights Park, San Francisco, California, USA Catching the morning light, Mr Pourahmad framed a male coyote's amber eye within the curve of a female's black\u2011tipped tail. He followed this pair across rocky hillside for a couple of hours and took his shot when the male paused to nuzzle the female. Coyotes are highly adaptable and are beginning to re\u2011establish themselves in San Francisco, where they had once disappeared from.\n\nLeana Kuster\n\nTitle: Pink Pose Photographer: Leana Kuster (Switzerland) Location: Pont de Gau, Camargue, France Leana Kuster shows a greater flamingo in the act of scratching its head with one of its unmistakably long legs. While on holiday she was fascinated by their foraging behaviour as they moved gracefully through the shallow, saline wetlands, filter-feeding for molluscs and crustaceans. Flamingos use their tongues to pump water through their uniquely adapted bills, which are lined with rows of fine, comblike plates. The greater flamingo's pink colouring comes from a diet high in carotenoids - pigments found in algae and invertebrates such as shrimp.\n\nMarina Cano\n\nTitle: Deadly Lessons Photographer: Marina Cano (Spain) Location: Samburu National Park, Samburu County, Kenya In Kenya's Samburu National Park, Marina Cano witnessed young cheetahs practising a hunt on a G\u00fcnther's dik\u2011dik, with their mother watching close by. Cheetah cubs stay hidden for two months and only join hunts at about a year old to learn stalking and killing skills.\n\nLakshitha Karunarathna\n\nTitle: Toxic Tip Photographer: Lakshitha Karunarathna (Sri Lanka) Location: Ampara, Eastern Province, Sri Lanka In Sri Lanka, Lakshitha Karunarathna documented a lone Asian elephant navigating a waste disposal site. Over the past three years, he has been recording the impacts of humans on elephants in the region. The landfill site in Ampara was created more than a decade ago near a protected wildlife zone that is home to about 300 elephants. Along with food scraps, they consume plastic, which slowly kills them, officials say.\n\nGabriella Comi\n\nTitle: Wake-up Call Photographer: Gabriella Comi (Italy) Location: Serengeti National Park, Tanzania Gabriella Comi and her guide David spotted a cobra moving towards two napping lions in the Serengeti National Park in the scorching midday sun. The eldest lion lifted its head to face the slithering threat.\n\nRalph Pace\n\nTitle: Jelly Smack Summer Photographer: Ralph Pace (USA) Location: Monterey Bay, Monterey, California, USA In the midst of a mass \u2013 or \"smack\" \u2013 of Pacific sea nettles, Mr Pace coated any skin not covered by his wetsuit with petroleum jelly to protect himself from stings. The trailing tentacles can deliver a painful sting, which Mr Pace says feels more like that of a bee than a nettle.\n\nSitaram Raul\n\nTitle: Nature Reclaims Its Space Photographer: Sitaram Raul (India) Location: Banda, Maharashtra, India In total darkness, Mr Raul stood amid fruit bats emerging from a historical ruin, using focus and flash to capture the moment. Bats swooped overhead while \"randomly pooping\" on him and his camera. In southern Asia, old world fruit bats often roost in abandoned buildings.\n\nIsaac Szabo\n\nTitle: Fragile River of Life Photographer: Isaac Szabo (USA) Location: Columbia County, Florida, USA Wading in a crystal clear Florida river, Mr Szabo photographed a female longnose gar alongside several males during the mating season. A turtle drifting into the scene was the \"icing on the cake\", according to Mr Szabo. This river is one of over 1,000 waterways fed by freshwater springs, known for their exceptional clarity. Protecting the aquifers that sustain these springs is essential, not only for iconic wildlife like manatees, but also for supplying drinking water to nearly half of Florida's population.\n\nJassen Todorov",

        "text": "Notting Hill Carnival revellers party in the sunny streets\n\n25 August 2025 Share Save Jess Warren BBC News and Victoria Cook, Harry Low and Briohny Williams BBC News, Notting Hill Carnival Share Save\n\nEPA EPA The colour-filled celebration has begun its second day in west London The main parade is followed by a day of live music filling the streets\n\nThe party atmosphere took hold of west London again as the main parade of the Notting Hill Carnival took place on its second day. Colourful costumes, dancing and music filled the streets of west London for Europe's biggest street party's children's day on Sunday, and the spectacle continued throughout Monday. The carnival, which celebrates Caribbean culture and history, has been running for more than 50 years. Carnival-goer Jeff Sam, 74, said: \"We are here to enjoy ourselves and we know it's going to be a fantastic day, something you have never dreamed in your life. \"You're going to see Brazilian bands, you're going to see Caribbean bands, you're going to see bands from all over the world coming and performing in beautiful costumes.\"\n\nEPA Bright costumes filled Notting Hill on Monday morning\n\nThousands of people lined the carnival route in the sunshine, with temperatures reaching 26C (79F) on Monday. Performing groups included Bajan Raw Licquer, Mahogany, Chocolate Nation, Mas Africa, Vincy Alliance and United Kreyol, which reflect traditions from Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados, St Lucia, Grenada, Jamaica, Dominica and Haiti. Brazilian performers from Paraiso Samba School, Batala and Dende Nation added to the line-up, alongside long-established UK community bands.\n\nReuters Tiered floats of performers made their way down the streets\n\nEPA The street party encourages people to wear ornate costumes to mark the celebration\n\nOne performer, Lauren, estimated that her costume contained about 500 jewels. Her sister made her outfit, while she made the tiara, Lauren explained. \"The tiaras take about two hours each,\" she told BBC London. \"They start off just as wire and we wrap them with fabric and then we add the gems on.\"\n\nJames Lewis, 41, who travelled to the event from Birmingham, said: \"It's amazing to see so many cultures coming together.\" Another visitor, Maria James, 34, added: \"It feels like a piece of the Caribbean right here in London.\"\n\nEPA Temperatures reached 26C on the second day of Notting Hill Carnival\n\nEPA The party continued after the parade, with music sounding out down the streets\n\nReuters The smell of jerked food has been wafting through the west London air\n\nMatt Vernon, from Beat Carnival in Belfast, said his group would be performing with puppets to commemorate Sonny Blacks, \"a key member of Notting Hill Carnival in the early days\". \"We built them very quickly, but very professionally in the last two weeks,\" he said. \"We leapt to the challenge and were very honoured to be asked to create these things.\" He said the puppets took \"a lot of core muscles and good vibes\" to show at Carnival.\n\nA puppet commemorating one of Carnival's organisers, Sonny Blacks, made up part of one display\n\nDerillio Alexander is performing in one of the bands on Monday\n\nEPA Major music and sound systems were switched off at 15:00 for a 72-second silence\n\nDerillio Alexander, 33, who is based in Amsterdam, said he was performing at Carnival with Ebony Steel Band. \"It's gonna be a big party,\" he said. \"We're gonna bust the place. It's always a pleasure to be here and we're gonna do our thing.\" More than a million people were expected to attend the festivities during the day. Carnival chair Ian Comfort said this year's event had so far been \"spectacular and safe\". On Monday evening, the Met Police said a total of 423 arrests had taken place during the two days of Carnival, but it had seen \"far fewer incidents of serious violence than in recent years\". There were two stabbings - one in Powis Terrace and one in Oxford Gardens - neither of which resulted in life-threatening injuries. Last year, eight people were stabbed during the Carnival. Comfort warned that funding was vital to keep it going every year, after writing to Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy in June to request government support. \"It's important that bands get funding because if bands don't get funding, you don't get the costumes, you don't get a parade,\" he said. \"Without funding we couldn't make it safe and we've invested a lot of money this year in improving safety in terms of both the staffing and also the technological infrastructure for the Carnival.\"\n\nPA Media Carnival has been running for more than 50 years\n\nReuters Drum beats were heard down the streets as the parade made progress\n\nMr Comfort added that more people needed to find out about the event's history. \"People need to look at why it was set up\u2026 Carnival brings people together. It's important it continues to bring people together as a show of unity,\" he said. \"If Carnival is a success, it's because everyone embraced it. It doesn't matter who they are, come and enjoy yourself.\"\n\nFollowing the Adult's Parade, Carnival continued with sound systems and live stages of music in Emslie Horniman's Pleasance Park and Powis Square. All major music and sound systems were switched off at 15:00 for a 72-second silence to commemorate the 72 lives lost in the Grenfell Tower fire, as well as those who have died at Carnival in recent years and Kelso Cochrane whose murder in 1959 became one of the catalysts for the event.\n\nPA Media The celebrations will continue long into the rest of the day\n\nOn Monday morning, Kensington and Chelsea Council said an estimated 150 tonnes of rubbish was cleared after Sunday's festivities. The council expects 300 tonnes to be collected over the weekend, with 180 staff and 45 vehicles working overnight. The clean-up will continue on Monday night to prepare the area for normal business on Tuesday morning.\n\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

Chris Killip spent time in Askam-in-Furness in 1981 and 1982, capturing the intersection between urban and rural life in the west Cumbrian coastal town by befriending members of the community. But while some images made their way into Killip's archive, he gave many of his portrait subjects the pictures back to hang in their own homes. A recent research project by Signal Film and Media gallery, in Barrow-in-Furness, saw it reconnect with the subjects of Killip's photographs, resulting in the discovery of more than 100 prints.\n\nCurated by Phil Northcott, the unseen images feature alongside the original Askam-in-Furness series, which was featured in Killip's photobook In Flagrante, his documentation of the deindustrialisation of northern England between 1973-1985. \"We know that Chris Killip developed a close relationship with members of the community and gave the portrait subjects their portraits to hang in their own homes,\" Mr Northcott said.\n\nChris Killip Photography Trust/Magnum Photos Man carrying sticks, Askam-in-Furness, Cumbria, 1982, featured in the original series\n\nChris Killip Photography Trust / Magnum Photos, courtesy of a private collection Askam Beach, 1982\n\nChris Killip Photography Trust / Magnum Photos, courtesy of a private collection On Askam Shore, 1982\n\nChris Killip Photography Trust / Magnum Photos, courtesy of a private collection On top of Askam Slag Bank, 1982\n\nChris Killip Photography Trust / Magnum Photos, courtesy of a private collection Playing pool Askam Youth club, 1982\n\nThe images were small gifts Killip made to individuals in Askam. Mr Northcott's friend Lee was photographed by Killip in Boy with Pigeon and given back the print, which features in the exhibition. \"These images offer us an important and poetic record of a community shaped by industry, landscape, and resilience,\" Mr Northcott said. \"While selected works in the series have been shown internationally, the complete series has never been shown in its entirety since Chris Killip shared his work with the Askam community soon after he'd made it, in 1982.\" The exhibition features 20 photographs from 1982, hand-printed by Killip and loaned by the Chris Killip Photography Trust and Martin Parr Foundation, and 59 digital scans which include those from within the community.\n\nChris Killip Photography Trust / Magnum Photos, courtesy of a private collection 2 members of the Askam Town Band, 1982\n\nChris Killip Photography Trust / Magnum Photos, courtesy of a private collection Boy with pigeon, 1982\n\n\"It's quite a small community, so it's not hard to track them down,\" Mr Northcott said. \"One thing he always said was that he preferred to see his pictures on people's walls instead of exhibitions.\" British documentary photographer Martin Parr described Killip as \"one of the key players in postwar British photography\". \"He led the way in which he would befriend the communities he photographed, and this created the intimacy and strength of his images.\" The complete series of Askam-in-Furness by Chris Killip runs at Signal's newly refurbished Cooke Studios in Barrow from 19 September to 1 November.\n\nFollow BBC Cumbria on X, Facebook, Nextdoor and Instagram.",

The Brazil-born photographer was known for his dramatic and unflinching black-and-white images of hardship, conflict and natural beauty, captured in 130 countries over 55 years. His hard-hitting photos chronicled major global events such as the Rwanda genocide in 1994, burning oilfields at the end of the Gulf War in 1991, and the famine in the Sahel region of Africa in 1984. \"His lens revealed the world and its contradictions; his life, the power of transformative action,\" said a statement from Instituto Terra, the environmental organisation he founded with his wife, L\u00e9lia Wanick Salgado.\n\nGetty Images Salgado dedicated himself to photographing nature and indigenous life in his later years\n\nSome of his most striking pictures were taken in his home country, including epic photos of thousands of desperate figures working in open-cast gold mines and striking images of the indigenous people of the Amazon.

He spent seven years on an ambitious photographic journey, exploring the remote reaches of the Amazon rainforest and documenting its inhabitants. The project culminated in an exhibition showcasing over 200 black-and-white images, offering a poignant glimpse into the region's landscapes and communities.

The images, including battling birds and squabbling squirrels, showed just what could be found \"under our noses\", said Andrew Fusek Peters. \"I wanted to celebrate the everyday stories and reveal the beauty of our birds, mammals and insects that live alongside us,\" the Shropshire photographer added. Hundreds of his images feature in a new book.\n\nAndrew Fusek Peters Two red squirrels were captured fighting in a back garden on the Isle of Wight\n\nThe majority of the photographs were taken in his \"modest\" garden, and local village of Lydbury. \"You don't have to travel to nature reserves or mountains,\" he said. \"I sometimes get snobbery from the big photographers who go to Africa and do the lions and tigers, or Greenland for the Polar bears,\" he explained. \"And they think I'm somehow inferior because I do blue tits in the garden.\"\n\nAndrew Fusek Peters The photographer set up a hide on a domestic lawn to capture this rare image of a mother hare suckling her leveret\n\nBut, he added, capturing rare images such as a hare feeding her leveret on someone's back lawn was \"just amazing\". \"At the time I took it, that had been photographed maybe less than 10 times in the world,\" he said. \"It was sheer gold on my memory card.\" He had also travelled to other parts of the UK in order to capture other \"extraordinary moments,\" including a fox family playing in Clapham, south London, and a pair of red squirrels on the Isle of Wight.\n\nAndrew Fusek Peters This pair of brightly coloured bramblings fighting over food was one of the photographer's favourite shots\n\nMr Fusek Peters started concentrating on his own garden wildlife after a diagnosis of bowel cancer in 2018, perfecting a technique to \"make time stop\" to get shots of birds and butterflies taking off and in mid flight. Using his kitchen as a hide, he has also taken rare pictures of birds - showing the effect of diffraction on their wings, giving a rainbow effect. \"This winter I got a woodpecker and a nuthatch\" he said, adding the images were \"extraordinary\". \"Everyone's going to accuse me of using AI, but it's not - it's actually scientific.\" He added he was \"one of the few in the world\" to have taken such images. \"I just seem to have this blessed luck when I concentrate on what's out of the kitchen window.\"\n\nAndrew Fusek Peters This image of a nuthatch is among the collection\n\nThe book was also a \"rallying cry\" to transform \"over-manicured spaces into more wildlife friendly havens,\" he said. \"These places are important, I think they really are,\" he added. \"As we know with climate change and with what's happening with habitat a lot of species are really suffering, and that includes our garden visitors so it's important to showcase them. \"They are just as important as all the wonderful creatures of the jungle and the desert,\" he added.\n\nAndrew Fusek Peters A fox family plays in Clapham, South London\n\nAndrew Fusek Peters This image of a ruby tailed wasp is included in the book\n\nSpringwatch presenter Iolo Williams said of the book, Garden Safari: \"Andrew makes the ordinary look extraordinary \u2013 stunning photography which helps to emphasise the importance of our gardens for wildlife.\" \"I think this is the best compliment I've ever had,\" the photographer commented.\n\nAndrew Fusek Peters A male pied flycatcher is captured bringing food to the nest\n\nAndrew Fusek Peters The photographer said it took six days to capture this image of a bank vole in his back garden\n\nGarden Safari is published by Graffeg Books\n\nFollow BBC Shropshire on BBC Sounds, Facebook, X and Instagram.",

This would be her last chance to contact her husband of four decades, the man she'd raised two children with, her Tony - to Ann, he was always her Tony.\n\nThe couple had made a pact. So long as Ann was in hospital with Covid, Tony would spend his nights dozing upright in a chair at their bungalow in Pewfall, Merseyside. That way, he would wake up if there was a message alert.\n\nIt wasn't much of a sacrifice, Tony thought, not when the woman he'd loved for 47 years was all by herself and frightened. And besides, each time his phone bleeped Tony would know she was still alive, and silently he'd thank the stars.\n\nAnd so in the early hours of Tuesday 7 April, Ann's last message arrived. She'd summoned the energy to take a farewell selfie as she lay in bed wearing an oxygen mask. \"She must have thought: 'Here's something so you won't forget me,'\" says Tony.\n\nTwo-and-a-half hours later, Ann was dead.

His determination to walk 100 laps of his garden before his 100th birthday transformed him into a defining figure of England's first national lockdown, making headlines and inspiring people from around the world to donate.\n\nAltogether, the centenarian, who died with coronavirus in Bedford Hospital on Tuesday, raised \u00a332.8m (\u00a339.3m including Gift Aid) in aid of the health service's charitable wing, NHS Charities Together. It is part of an overall \u00a3150m collected for the fund as part of its Covid-19 Urgent Appeal.\n\nHospital staff treating the sickest patients have been under intense pressure in recent months, and a recent study suggested that many had been left traumatised by their experience during the first wave last spring.\n\nAt the time, there was much publicity given to shortages of protective clothing for staff, and the need for medical apparatus. But these are classed as \"core\" equipment and funded by tax payers. The focus of Charities Together is the comfort and wellbeing of staff and patients - things that, in the words of one NHS worker, \"make their working lives easier\". Ellie Orton, the charity's chief executive, said the donations helped staff \"focus on their life saving work at a time of immense pressure\".\n\nBack in May, I spoke to NHS staff about how the money was helping.\n\nThis article was originally run on 25 May 2020.",

        "text": "As the prime minister announced that pubs and restaurants in England can reopen from 4 July, we went to see how one neighbourhood might emerge from the coronavirus lockdown.\n\nBrixton appears almost normal. There's a steady stream of people weaving their way in and out of shops - most of which are open. The tangy scent of raw seafood at the fishmongers mixes with that of over-ripe bananas on the fruit stalls. And Whitney Houston songs are blaring out from somewhere, giving the sunny scene an extra zing of flavour and energy. So far, so Brixton. But the many boarded-up businesses down the backstreets of this buzzing south-London neighbourhood are a tell-tale sign of the effect lockdown has had on trade.\n\nAs general manager of the covered markets that make up Brixton Village, Diana Nabagereka looks out at the hustle and bustle with a smile on her face. \"For the first two weeks of lockdown it was like Brixton was in a coma,\" she says, accepting that people did, at least initially, stay at home. \"But then God made the sun shine and everything changed.\"\n\nShe says during the warm weather at the beginning of April, she came down from her office in the market to find someone had brought out a sound system to entertain the crowds on Electric Avenue - it was \"like Notting Hill Carnival\".",
